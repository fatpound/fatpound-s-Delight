# General Algorithms & Utilities

Compile the source codes on a Visual Studio 2022 Environment (any edition) and using MSVC with /std:c++latest option on.

I suggest you to open the source code files in Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 and use Ctrl + M + O keyboard key combination to collapse all the methods and functions to read the code easily.

Note : NONE of these classes support SIMD or other vectorizations. Except unique cases, there is no need to implement those whilst there is a pre-made or built libraries for almost any kind of job that needs to be done. The codes are just there to learn some of the algorithms while using latest C++ standards.
