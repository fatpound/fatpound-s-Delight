# General Algorithms & Utilities

Using the project
-----------------
Just add the headers and sources to your project's include folder.
The headers and sources are -Wall -Wextra clean on Clang 18.

If you use Microsoft Visual Studio 2022, you can use Ctrl + M + O keyboard key combination to collapse all the methods and functions to read the code easily.

Note : NONE of these classes support SIMD or other vectorizations. Except unique cases, there is no need to implement those whilst there is a pre-made or built libraries for almost any kind of job that needs to be done. The codes are just there to learn some of the algorithms while using latest C++ standards.
