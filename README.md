# General Algorithms & Utilities

Using the project
-----------------
Just add the headers and sources to your project's include folder.

The codes are:\
-Wall -Wextra clean on Clang++ 18\
-Wall clean on MSVC v19.41.34120.0

There are some unnecessary warnings so I disabled them.\
You can see them in Visual Studio property sheet files CMakeSettings_*.cmake files

If you use Microsoft Visual Studio 2022, you can use Ctrl + M + O keyboard key combination to collapse all the methods and functions to read the code easily.
